# ðŸ’» DSA-Practice

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository!  
This repo is dedicated to my daily coding journey where I solve DSA problems using **Java** â€” from basics to advanced.

## ðŸ“… Daily Progress

Iâ€™m following a structured plan that includes:

- âœ… Pattern-based problems (Basic to Advanced)
- âœ… Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.
- âœ… Recursion, Sorting, Searching, Backtracking, and more
- âœ… Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Roadmap
- âœ… Java Concepts with Hands-on Practice
